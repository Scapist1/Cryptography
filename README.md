# Cryptography

The CLI is intergrated with different if functions and string comparisons. First step in the code makes sure it don't runs any further if it doesn't get more than 4 arguments and if you provide the command-line with something it won't cipher it will prompt the menu. 
I have made a ".h" and ".c" file to each cipher + a header file to store a static menu I use a couple of times in the main.c
Inside of each cipher are two seperate encoding and decoding loops. The file will encode or decode depending on the command-line message.
